<h1>Technology Choices</h1>


</ul><h4><p>The page or area describing the choices available to us through or by your chosen technology/topic.<p></h4>

As more cars are equipped with self-driving capabilities insurance rates may lower or cease to exist as the AI is able to communicate with other self-driving cars on the road allowing them to anticipate each other's intentions accurately which would lead to a dramatic decrease in car accidents which in turn would make insurance rates lower or completely obsolete. On the other hand, as there could be lower insurance rates there may also be some kind of recurring payment that the vehicle manufacturer forces buyers to subscribe to to be able to drive their cars or would limit functionality inside the car or how far the car would be able to drive among a plethora of other restrictions given that there are no laws set in place to limit what manufacturers are able to force customers to do in order to drive their vehicles.<br><br>

As the technology around self-driving AI progresses there will eventually be a point where the AI is able to outperform an average person in driving ability. As the AI is able to make decisions within a few milliseconds it can very quickly decide what the best course of action is and avoid being in a situation that may have resulted in an accident if there was a person driving the car instead. Although, as the cars are still susceptible to hacking attacks this can also lead to damaged equipment on the car or severe injury or fatalities for people inside the car if hackers manage to exploit the self-driving AI and control it themselves.<br><br>

There would be a lower cost to operate self-driving vehicles as the AI is designed to drive more conservatively and efficiently than a human would be able to. Given that all self-driving cars transition to using hydrogen or electricity for fuel there would be a significant decrease in environmentally damaging emissions from cars if a majority of these cars use more environmentally friendly fuels instead of natural gases. Eventually, every type of vehicle could be fitted with some type of self-driving AI and be very efficient to operate not only cost wise but environmentally as well. There are already several hydrogen fuel cell powered vehicles around the United States being used in companies such as Amazon and Walmart. With hydrogen refuelling stations being publicly available in California and Hawaii and more in development in New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Connecticut and Rhode Island. There are also several hydrogen fuel cell powered buses already in use or planned in Ohio, Michigan, Illinois and Massachusetts, as well as California.
