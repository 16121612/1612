With the information regarding the risks of self-driving vehicles, I find it highly unethical that companies like Tesla provide access to their autopilot feature despite all the limitations that have been presented to them by the National Transportation Safety Board and security companies such as Tencent Keen Security Lab. I believe Tesla needs to improve on the reliability of its software to prevent further crash as one fatal accident is already one too many. While the feature has worked more times than not, the safety of their drivers and passengers should always be their highest priority and simply advising them not to place full reliance on the autopilot is not sufficient. As the NTSB advised, Tesla should have features that have the driver engaged with what is happening on the road at all times, monitor the driver's capabilities and ensure they are always in a reliable state before turning on the autopilot.
