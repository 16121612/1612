<h1>Technology Risks</h1>


</ul><h4><p>The page or area describing the risks posed by your chosen technology/topic.<p></h4>

The software in Tesla vehicles “regularly receive over-the-air software updates that add new features and enhance existing ones over Wi-Fi”. As programmers, we are aware that one simple error in a program can change its entire course of action. While these updates are intended to amend any existing issues with the software and/or introduce new features, these regular updates also pose the threat of introducing new bugs and program errors which could possibly lead to injured passengers and even fatality.<br><br>

While Tesla does not recommend full reliance on the autopilot feature, it begs the question “How reliable is the autopilot then?”. In 2018, one of Tesla’s vehicles was involved in a fatal car accident which the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) found Tesla partially at fault. After a thorough investigation that was carried out for months, NTSB identified seven safety issues that were related to the fatal incident, one of the findings being limitations in Tesla’s crash avoidance system. When the vehicle approached a damaged barrier, instead of the vehicles crash avoidance responding to the obstacle, the car instead accelerated into the concrete barrier. As mentioned in the investigation findings, Tesla’s vehicles are only programmed to avoid situation it is programmed to which means it is not perfect and therefore poses a risk to drivers and passengers on board who rely solely on the autopilot feature when driving. The NTSB recommended that Tela implement features to monitor drivers who have the autopilot feature activated and continually have them engaged and focused on the road. Having the driver engaged at all times is important as security researchers have found that it does not take much to fool the Artificial Intelligence software.<br><br>

One facility, Tencent Keen Security Lab, found that they were able to “bamboozle a Tesla Model S into switching lanes so that it drives directly into oncoming traffic”. Tencent Keen Security Lab found that they could launch an attack and hack into the Tesla Model S system, interfere with software, and have the car act abnormally. In a real-life scenario, these types of attacks could lead to fatal accidents and therefore the software should be examined closely. In conclusion, Tencent Keen stated that they “hope that the potential product defects exposed by these tests can be paid attention to by the manufacturers and improve the stability and reliability of their consumer-facing automotive products”. With this knowledge of artificial intelligence powering the autopilot system not being perfect, it is evident that more work is needed to stabilize the system and its software and improve its reliability before providing access to this feature. Hopefully, companies like Tesla can include much needed features in future updates to protect their beloved car owners.
