<h1>Technology Opportunities</h1>

<ul>Less incentives to owning vehicles.</ul>

The average cost of owning a car is estimated to be around $8,000 per annual. Needless to say, it is costly to own and maintain a personal vehicle as compared to public transportation which is 3x cheaper. However, this problem could easily be a thing of the past with the addition of driverless AI vehicles. Ride share services like Uber have invested well over 1 billion dollars into autonomous vehicles, which will produce a fleet of driverless vehicles. Without the need of human drivers to pay, the operational costs of such a fleet would drastically decrease in price for customers, providing people with an alternative to driving personal vehicles. 

Getting people to their destinations more efficiently with the high possibility of reducing number of vehicles driven has many indirect environmental impacts. It is good to remember that the less fuel burned means in less fuel sold, which ultimately results in a less demanding need for fossil fuel resources and the many emission-heavy processes used to extract the fossil fuels. And if this positive trend continues in our society, we can soon start seeing people using ride-sharing services more than purchasing their own vehicles, eventually fewer cars needed to be manufactured, which reduces the impact of that process as well. Another thing to note is that the more hours a vehicle is used through car-sharing, any related up-front battery costs could be shared, also noting that it does not require passengers to figure out a place to park. Increasing the economic appeal of AI driven vehicles. All of these factors can very potentially spur a higher demand for vehicle-sharing, also known as car-pooling.  

<ul>Reduced Congestion</ul>

The price difference is not the only thing to entice people, along with AI driven vehicles comes reduced traffic congestion. It is also good to note that there is various of different factors that might cause traffic congestions, car crashes/accidents and multiple stop-and-go traffic waves that often causes clusters of congestions. This can be addressed with AI driven vehicles, AI are able to maintain a safe and consistent distance between vehicles, allowing to reduce accidents caused by human error and the number of stop-and-go waves that produce traffic congestions. 

These AI advancements also stand to have a direct impact on the environment by reducing the number of vehicles on the road and helping those that remain get where they are going more efficiently. Even features like collision avoidance accomplish this indirectly: Fewer accidents means less traffic congestion and fewer emergency vehicle dispatches. Reduced number of traffic congestions means saving fuel and ultimately reducing greenhouse gases from needless vehicle idling. Public transportation accounts for more than one quarter of greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S., according to the studies at EPA.  It is not just about convenience, but our environment as well. 

<ul>Reduced Emissions / Environmental Impacts</ul>

If the cost efficiency and reduced accidents/congestions still is not enough to entice. AI driven vehicles can be programmed to maximise it is potential to reduce fuel use and carbon emission by up to 60%, leaving a minimum environmental impact on our planet. 

But it is not just about convenience. These AI advancements also stand to have a direct impact on the environment by reducing the number of vehicles on the road and helping those that remain get where they are going more efficiently. Even features like collision avoidance accomplish this indirectly: Fewer accidents means less traffic congestion and fewer emergency vehicle dispatches.

AI Driven Vehicles are programmed to handle the road quicker and better. 

Human driven vehicles will always make errors on the road, whether we admit it or not, it is part of being human. While human driven errors do not always end up in accidents, drivers can make mistakes behind the wheel that make their vehicles run inefficiently. For instance, pressing down on the gas accelerator too quickly or slamming on the brakes unnecessary can easily jolt the car in and out of motion. While a calculated driving style can easily reduce the fuel required to keep the car moving at its maximum efficiency.

AI driven vehicles are programmed to precisely gauge when and where to accelerate and brake, and this is just two of the ways an AI helps to preserve vehicle’s resources. AI driven vehicles are programmed with built-in technology that allows vehicles to interact with other machines. This allows vehicles to drive with increased speed while remaining in a safe distance. Traveling in a close-knit style manner allows passengers to get to their desired destinations quickly, safer, and more sustainably, this close-knit commute also reduces vehicles’ energy usage by up to 25 percent.
