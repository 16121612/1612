<h2>Ethical issues relating to the technology, your personal reflections and recommendations </h2>

<h4><em>[Note: Your individual and unique perspective on the topic/issue].</em></h4><br>

I personally think that as a beginner learning about how the technology works with regards to programming. The only ethical issue is when we go deeper into how AI conflicts with its programmed state and its need to balance the safety of others – pedestrians or cyclists – with the interests of cars' passengers with mundane situations such as crosswalks, round-a-bouts, and intersections. While this dilemma still remains a debate, there is a lot of good that it can provide such as AI Driven Vehicles being able to be programmed to handle the road quicker/better, Reduced Emissions/Environmental Impacts, and the list only improves as technology furthers in development.
